# Quantum-Glasses-Project

Quantum-Glasses
This Project is a member of IBM Qiskit Ecosystem
## Points to remember while recreating
1. Install tkinter and qiskit in a virtual environment
2. Paste the files from github (or clone) into the environment
3. Use conda virtual environment, installing qiskit with pip can lead to issues
4. Use Python version 3.8.10, qiskit has issues with version 3.9

## Built using: Python, Tkinter, Qiskit

## main.py contains the application which can help to visualise the operations performed on a qubit when we apply basic quantum gates.
## functions.py contains additional functions for the execution of the application.
